## Notes

- atoms and selectors are core concepts from the Recoil state management library.

- Atom = An atom is the smallest unit of state in Recoil. It's similar to a single piece of state in React's useState or Redux, but it's shared across components.

- A selector is a derived state in Recoil. It allows you to compute or transform atom values or combine multiple atoms into a single output.
